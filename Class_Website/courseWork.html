      					<td>CS 220 - Data Structures</td>
      					<td>Taught in Java, I learned about the main data structures that are used today. Lists, stacks/queues, trees, and graphs are some of the most important structures that I was taught. Object-oriented programming was a big part of the class, as I learned about useful real world applications such as object manipulation with trees. Basic algorithms such as breadth/depth first searches were taught. I really enjoyed this class, and the Java knowledge definitely comes in handy.</td>

    				<tr>
      					<td>CS 280 - Computational Statistics</td>
      					<td>This was mostly a statistics class, but I also learned some interesting computer science. The class was taught in Python, which I have found to be a useful language in the current CS world. Also, many times the professor gave us large data sets to work with. At first these were difficult and I tried to use excel to format, but by the end of the class, I used Python for everything. The one really interesting thing we did in the class was work on the basics of machine learning.</td>
