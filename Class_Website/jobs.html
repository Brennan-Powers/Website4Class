      					<td>I taught classes on different aspects of nature to kids ages 12-18. The topics I instructed for included forestry, environmental science, geology, astrology, fish and wildlife management, fishing, fly fishing, and bird study. I scheduled classes and graded hundreds of papers over the course of the summer and leaned a lot about time management and organizing others. I also learned that I love working with children and teaching.</td>

      					<td>Philmont is the largest youth camp in the world. At the southern tip of the Rocky Mountains, we host hiking and outdoor activities to campers from all walks of life. My job was to keep the younger kids that came with families and such entertained and alive. From taking care of babies to mountaineering with 20 somethings, I learned a lot about responsability and how to work with all different kinds of people. However, the most important thing I learned was patience, patience to corral 40 wild children, patience to deal with overbearing/crazy parents, and patience to calmly deal with a bear eyeing my kids.</td>

I worked in the garden center in the summer because of my knowledge of gardening, and then in hardware durring the off season. I enjoyed learning a lot about construction and tools. The most important thing I learned though was customer service. Dealing with difficult customers is definitely a skill I am glad to say I possess. </td>
