      					<td class="syl">CS 220 - Data Structures</td>
      					<td>Taught in Java, I learned about the main data structures that are used today. Lists, stacks/queues, trees, and graphs are some of the most important structures that I was taught. Object-oriented programming was a big part of the class, as I learned about useful real world applications such as object manipulation with trees. Basic algorithms such as breadth/depth first searches were taught. I really enjoyed this class, and the Java knowledge definitely comes in handy.</td>

    				<tr>
      					<td class="syl">CS 280 - Computational Statistics</td>
      					<td>This was mostly a statistics class, but I also learned some interesting computer science. The class was taught in Python, which I have found to be a useful language in the current CS world. Also, many times the professor gave us large data sets to work with. At first these were difficult and I tried to use excel to format, but by the end of the class, I used Python for everything. The one really interesting thing we did in the class was work on the basics of machine learning.</td>
      					<td class="syl"><a href="http://www.cs.siu.edu/_common/documents/courses/CS%20280-Revised-April17.pdf">CS 280</a></td>
    				</tr>

    				<tr>
    					<td class="syl">CS 311 - Theory of Programming</td>
    					<td>Using both Java and LISP this class taught me more about the underlying principals of programming more than any other class I have ever taken. From the basics of automata with simple languages and grammars to complex structures of programs and compilers we covered a wide span of topics that increased my understanding of coding. LISP was also very interesting to learn and will definitely help if I ever need to do any functional programming in the future.

    				</tr>

    				<tr>
    					<td class="syl">CS 320 - Computer Architecture</td>
    					<td>Taking a deeper look into how the hardware in a computer operates on binary is a very interesting topic. While beyond what a programmer needs to know to code, it is with out a doubt useful knowledge to have. If I ever go into a field that requires me to work at an extremely low level then what I learned in this class will be invaluable.</td>

    				<tr>
    					<td class="syl">CS 330 - Introduction to Algorithms</td>
    					<td>In this class we started by learning how to analyze programs and the underlying algorithms that make them up. We then moved on to look at specific problems programmers have faced in the past and how they solved them. There were many unique situations we analyzed and learned how to overcome. Using algorithms in new ways to solve different problems is always a fun challenge and something I hope to do in the future.</td>
